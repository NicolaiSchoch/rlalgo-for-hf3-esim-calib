# rlalgo-for-hf3-esim-calib

A Reinforcement Q-Learning Framework usable for Parameter Identification, Calibration and Data Assimilation in the context of a HiFlow3-based Elasticity Simulation.

For more information: See preprint (in progress) "Parameter Identification and Data Assimilation for HiFlow3-based Elasticity Simulation by means of Reinforcement Q-Learning".

If you want to use the RL Framework and the underlying HiFlow3-based Elasticity Simulation source code, please cite this paper.
